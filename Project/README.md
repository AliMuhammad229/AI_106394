# Description: How we Achieved each Task?


In this project, we implement four classification techniques


 1.  Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes
 2.  Linear Regression 
 3.  SUM 
 4.  KNN 

In each technique, we are using 3 convolution 5x5,7x7,9x9 on two different filters.
   1. We have 784 columns of pixels, it breaks into 28x28, then we create a new array of new dimensions/size (2D Array) and apply 5x5 convolution.
   2. After the implementation of 5x5 convolution, new array will became in the shape of (0, 576) because this 5x5 convolution will implemented on 42000                 rows of train.csv
